# TASK SPECIFICATION: dalmatian-trainer

## Introduction & Motivation
Welcome to the dalmatian-trainer project. Here we will develop a set of sigital and physical resources (including a 3D printable hands on rig) for new starters within the team to be able to teach themselves digital image correlation (DIC). 

## Aim & Objectives 


For 2D-DIC:
- Basics of optical systems 
    - Pinhole camera model
    - Lens, maginification limits, lighting
- Speckle patterns
    
- Rigid body and out-of-plane motion tests

- Uncertainty quantification best practice
    - Grey level image noise analysis
    - Requirements for noise floor analysis on QOIs

For Stereo-DIC:
- Stereo calibration best practice
