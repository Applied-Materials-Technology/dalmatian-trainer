# Stereo-DIC Training Laboratory
## Basic Camera Setup and Analysis
The first part of the Stereo-DIC assignment focuses on the basic setup of a Stereo-DIC experiment and the analysis of various characteristics of the Stereo-DIC measurement system. In this exercise you will use a calibration target and the calibration software to establish the relationship between the cameras and their orientation relative to the specimen.

**Equipment Required**:
- Capture computer
- Camera
- Fixed Focal Length Lenses
- Mounting Equipment (tripods)
- Calibration Target
- Speckle Pattern Target
- Lighting equipment

**General Setup**:

1. Mount the two cameras to the tripod provided. Ensure both cameras are focused on the same region of interest (ROI) of the specimen.  Adjust the stero angle between the cameras.
2. Connect power cable and ethernet cables to the camera, and plug these into the power board and ethernet port accordingly.

    a. To ensure cameras are connected and communicating with the computer, lights on the back of the camera ethernet port should be green.

**Specimen Preparation**
1. Surface Preparation - Ensure the surface of the specimen is clean and dry.
2. Speckle Pattern Application - Apply a high-contrast, random speckle pattern to the surface of the specimen.
